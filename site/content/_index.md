I'm **Leon**, a Content and User Experience specialist. I recently worked at [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com/), maker of the best little wireframing tool around. I love bridging the gap between people and technology to help customers get the most out of your product.

I co-wrote a book called [*Wireframing for Everyone*](https://balsamiq.com/learn/wireframing-book/) —
